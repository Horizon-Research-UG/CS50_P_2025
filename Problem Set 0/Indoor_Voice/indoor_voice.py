# Name: indoor.py 
# Meta: implement a program in Python
# Ticket 1: that prompts the user for input and then 
print()
x = input("Hallo, schreib mal bitte was : )  ---->  : ")
print()

# outputs that same input in lowercase.
print(x.lower())
print()
#   Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. 
# 
# You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.


# so Aufgabe erfüllt -> schonmal pushen
